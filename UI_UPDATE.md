### Why This Is Better

1. **Cleaner Sidebar**

   - Focus on main dashboard sections
   - User management actions moved to quick actions

2. **Centralized Quick Actions**
   - Add/Remove User are frequently used together
   - Both accessible from Overview (default view)
   - No need to navigate sidebar for common tasks

3. **Logical Grouping**
   - Quick Actions = Frequent admin tasks
