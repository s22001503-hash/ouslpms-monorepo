## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Backend won't start:**
- Check Firebase credentials path
- Ensure virtual environment is activated
- Verify port 8000 is not in use

**Dean can't login:**
- Run `create_dean_user.py` script
- Check Firestore for user document with EPF 60001
- Verify role is set to 'dean'

**Proposals not showing:**
- Login as Admin first and create a proposal
- Check Firestore `settings_requests` collection
- Verify status is 'pending'

**Reports empty:**
- Create some test data in `print_logs` collection
- Submit proposals as admin
- Wait for data to accumulate

2. **Create multiple proposals** to test the review interface
3. **Export reports** to verify CSV functionality
